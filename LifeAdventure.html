          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherever you are from in this world,
          New York is probably the best place to be nostalgic because your
          are very likely to come across your mother tongue on street. And,
          don't miss out the barbecue in Korea town!

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in Pitt in Japan 2016 and really
          met many awesome people there. We were in Kobe and Osaka for most of
          the time, but also travelled to surrounding cities like Kyoto, Nara
          and Awaji Island. I even adventured to Tokyo by myself! I got tons
          of comic books there...and lots of excitement!

          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friends and I took a road trip to
          Cleveland and Buffalo during last winter break and had a lot of fun.
          Niagara falls are great! But it was so cold that all of us were
          trembeling in wind so we did not take pictures lol. Try the restraunt
          named Lihua. They have the authentic Dimsam dishes from Hongkong!
